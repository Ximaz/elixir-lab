# Elixir Lab

This repository is just a monolith of all my Elixir projects as I am learning
the language. You might find interesting pieces of code, but if you are already
familiar with the language, the only thing you may be interested on is to open
pull requests to show me a better way to code, or some issues if you find bugs.

All the code inside this monolith is not intended for production, as it will be
learning code. It might be a mess, or even incomplete. Just so you are aware.
Beside that, you can grab anything in there and use it in your personnal
projects, if they are not critical.

I would be glad for any sugestion inside my projects' source code, as I want to
learn the language, but also get the best practices as soon as possible.
